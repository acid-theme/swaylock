# Acid for swaylock

Two flavours: **Acetic** (`#000000`), vibrant, and **Citric** (`#1c1b19`), muted.

Part of [Acid](https://github.com/acid-theme/acid), a very dark colourscheme in two
flavours. The main README lists the other ports.

## Preview

## Install

swaylock has no include directive, so this is a colours-only config to compose
with. Keep local options in a separate file and concatenate the two:

```sh
curl -fsSLo /tmp/acid-acetic.conf \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acid-theme/swaylock/main/acid-acetic.conf
cat ~/.config/swaylock/base.conf /tmp/acid-acetic.conf > ~/.config/swaylock/config
```

Or add local options to a copy and point swaylock at it with `swaylock -C`. Keep
the two files disjoint: an unrecognised key makes swaylock exit rather than
lock.

All 29 of swaylock's colour options are set, so nothing falls back to its
light-grey default.
